# Kaomoji

Kaomojis are a type of emoticon originating from Japan, used to express emotions, actions, or ideas through combinations of text characters. This tool contains a list of kaomojis, and translates text into them. For example: 

happy: (＾▽＾)
sad: (╥_╥)
excited: ＼(^o^)／

The dictionary feature can be used to see what words can be translated, and add new words.
